`cp [other_dir]/token.txt .`
`docker build .`
`./build.sh`
- add "safety_checker=None" to `pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(`
`./build.sh run "a cherry that looks like an orange"`

- possibly modify build.sh to include new volumes in two different places (dev/build?), e.g.:
```
-v "$PWD"/weights:/home/huggingface/weights \
-v "$PWD"/content:/home/huggingface/content \
```
